# Project Instructions for Claude

This project is a high-end web map application for "Aves Rapaces" (Raptor Birds) in Colombia.

## Guidelines
1. **Design First**: Prioritize aesthetics. The user wants "Premium", "Light Mode", "Purple".
2. **Tech Stack**: Vanilla JS with Vite. No React/Vue/Angular unless explicitly requested later.
3. **Tailwind**: Use Tailwind for all styling.
4. **Map**: Use Leaflet.js. Ensure controls are styled to match the theme (custom Zoom buttons, etc.).

## Current Status
- Setup phase.
- `plans/` directory contains detailed roadmaps.
- `public/assets/logo.png` is the project logo.
